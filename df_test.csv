The Undo feature is a great addition as well. I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look.
